# Chess_Game
A two-player chess game built in C++ with Raylib


## Two-Player Chess Game (C++ with Raylib)**
This is a two-player chess game built in C++ using the Raylib graphics library.
It was developed as a group project by our BSCS team to apply object-oriented programming concepts, file handling, and game development logic.

## Overview
This chess game provides an interactive experience between two players on the same computer.
It includes all standard chess rules such as check, checkmate, stalemate, pawn promotion, and castling.
The project is built entirely in C++ using Raylib for rendering and input handling.

## Features
* Implements all standard chess rules
* Allows pawn promotion with a piece selection dialog
* Supports castling and en passant
* Save and load game functionality
* Undo and redo system
* Player timers with incremental time
* User interface and menu system
* Developed with OOP and modular structure

## Technologies Used
Language: C++
Graphics Library: Raylib
Programming Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming
Concepts Used: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation
File Handling: Used for saving and loading game state
IDE/Tools: Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or g++ compiler
